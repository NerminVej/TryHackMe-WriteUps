## Task 2 Cyber Threat Intelligence

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is evidence-based knowledge about adversaries.
The goal of CTI is to understand the relationship the adversary has to your operational environment and how to defend it.
-   Whoâ€™s attacking you?
-   What are their motivations?
-   What are their capabilities?
-   What artefacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you look out for?

Strategic Intel looks into an organisation's threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends.
Technical Intel looks at evidences.
Tactial Intel assess tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the adversary.
Operational Intel looks at the motives of the adversary.
